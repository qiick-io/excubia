# qiick Excubia — Specification v0.1.0

> Status: **APPROVED by Luca on 2026-10-31** (all recommendations in section 10 accepted). This file and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` are the single source of truth for v0.1.0. Anything not written here is out of scope; new ideas become `needs-decision` proposal issues, not code.

> Decisions D1–D13 and A1–A2 are final (section 10). Anything still marked **[PROPOSAL]** is not approved and must not be built; open a `needs-decision` issue instead.

## 1. Product

**qiick Excubia** is an open-source (MIT) health check for Laravel projects. It reads a project's lockfiles and manifests and reports, in one place: PHP / Laravel / Node end of life, known vulnerabilities, abandoned and stale packages, blockers for the next Laravel major, and a suggested upgrade order.

Why it exists (knowledge base): `composer audit` only checks CVEs; laravelversions.com only shows EOL; Laravel Shift is paid per upgrade; laravel/vet reviews package code (complementary); LaraPlugins scores single packages, not your project; Enlightn is archived. Nothing combines EOL, CVEs, abandoned packages, upgrade order and a summary in one report.

It is roadmap **Step 1, Phase A** of the qiick suite. Phase B (uptime, connectors, runtime probe `qiick/excubia-probe`) is roadmap Step 4 and is **not** part of this spec.

Branding: always **"qiick Excubia"** (package `qiick/excubia-core`, repo `qiick-io/excubia-core`). Never "Excubia" alone in headings, never the q tile next to the qiick wordmark, Vigil Blue accent, tagline placeholder "Health checks for Laravel apps." (TBD).

### Target users
1. Laravel developers and freelancers maintaining one or more apps.
2. Agencies with many client apps that need a quick "how bad is it?" report before quoting an upgrade.
3. CI pipelines (GitHub Actions) that should fail on critical findings.
4. AI coding agents (Cursor, Claude Code) that run the CLI and read JSON/Markdown output (Agent-First rule).

## 2. Scope v0.1.0

In scope:
- A framework-agnostic PHP **core** (parsers, checks, data-source clients, cache, report model).
- A **CLI** shipped in the same Composer package: `vendor/bin/excubia check` (standalone, no app boot) and, when installed in a Laravel app, the alias `php artisan excubia:check` (auto-discovered service provider). See Decision D1.
- Inputs: `composer.lock` (required), `composer.json` (optional, for PHP constraint and direct vs. transitive deps), `package-lock.json` (optional), `package.json` / `.nvmrc` / `.node-version` (optional, Node version).
- Output formats: `table` (default, human), `json`, `markdown`. `sarif` is deferred to v0.3.0 (D6).
- Local file cache of data-source responses with TTLs, and `--offline` mode.
- CI: own GitHub Actions workflow + first reusable workflow in `qiick-io/.github` (roadmap Step 1 explicitly includes "`qiick-io/.github` reusable workflows").
- Release to Packagist as `qiick/excubia-core` v0.1.0.

### Explicit NON-goals for v0.1.0
- No uptime monitoring, multi-region probes, connectors or runtime probe (Phase B, Step 4).
- No paid features, no qiick Cloud, no accounts, no login, no telemetry.
- No web scanner in v0.1.0 (it is milestone v0.2.0, section 9; Decision D2).
- No code changes to the scanned project (read-only; no auto-fix, no `composer update`).
- No source-code analysis (that is laravel/vet's job); only manifests/lockfiles.
- No AI summary in v0.1.0 (D4; no metered services without Luca's approval).
- No GitHub App / PR comments / scheduled multi-repo monitoring / badges (knowledge base "Later, Pro/CI mode").

## 3. Health checks

Severity levels: `critical` > `high` > `medium` > `low` > `info`. Each finding has: `checkId`, `severity`, `status` (`pass` | `warn` | `fail` | `skipped`), `subject` (package or runtime), `message`, `fixHint`, `evidenceUrl`, and `advisoryId` (so an ignore rule can match one advisory).

| ID | Name | Inspects | Data source | Fail | Warn | Pass | Fix hint |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `php-eol` | PHP end of life | Resolved PHP version: `config.platform.php` > `require.php` lower bound in `composer.json` > `platform` in `composer.lock` | endoflife.date `php` | Security support ended (**critical**) | Active support ended, security support ends within 180 days (**medium**) | Supported | "Upgrade PHP to X.Y (supported until DATE)." |
| `laravel-eol` | Laravel end of life | Locked `laravel/framework` version | endoflife.date `laravel` | Security fixes ended (**critical**) | Bug fixes ended or security ends within 180 days (**medium**) | Supported | "Upgrade to Laravel N; security fixes for your version end DATE." |
| `node-eol` | Node end of life | `.nvmrc`, `.node-version`, `package.json` `engines.node` | endoflife.date `nodejs` | EOL (**high**) | Maintenance ends within 180 days (**low**) | Supported / `skipped` if not declared | "Move to Node LTS N." (Brand copy mentions PHP/Node versions; D7) |
| `composer-advisories` | Known vulnerabilities (Composer) | Every locked package + version (incl. dev, flag `--no-dev` to exclude) | Packagist security advisories API (GitHub Advisory DB + FriendsOfPHP) | Any advisory affecting the locked version; severity mapped from advisory (critical/high/medium/low) | — | No advisories | "Update vendor/package to ≥ fixed version (advisory ID)." |
| `npm-advisories` | Known vulnerabilities (npm) | Every package in `package-lock.json` (v2/v3) | OSV.dev batch query | Any vulnerability affecting the locked version (severity from OSV/CVSS, default medium) | — | None / `skipped` if no lockfile | "Update package to ≥ fixed version." |
| `composer-abandoned` | Abandoned packages | Packagist `abandoned` flag of each locked package | Packagist metadata | Abandoned, direct dependency (**high**) | Abandoned, transitive (**medium**) | Not abandoned | "Replace with `<suggested replacement>`" (from Packagist), or "no replacement suggested" |
| `composer-stale` | Stale packages | Last release date (Packagist) and GitHub `archived` / last push | Packagist metadata + GitHub API (unauthenticated, optional `GITHUB_TOKEN`) | Repository archived (**high**) | No release for > 24 months (**low**, threshold configurable) | Recent release | "Consider a maintained alternative." Demo case: `jenssegers/agent` |
| `laravel-next-blocker` | Next-major blockers | For each direct dependency requiring `illuminate/*` or `laravel/framework`: does its **latest** release allow the next Laravel major (today `^13`)? | Packagist metadata | Latest release does not allow next major (**medium**) | Allows it only in a pre-release (**low**) | Allows it / not Laravel-dependent | "No release supports Laravel N yet; watch / replace / fork." |
| `upgrade-plan` | Upgrade order | Combines the above into an ordered list: security fixes → runtime EOL (PHP) → blockers → Laravel major → stale/abandoned replacements | Derived | — (always `info`) | — | — | Ordered, numbered steps |

Notes:
- "180 days" and "24 months" are defaults, configurable (section 5).
- `upgrade-plan` is a report section, never changes the exit code.
- Node version precedence is `.nvmrc` > `.node-version` > `package.json` `engines.node`.
- The next Laravel major is the locked `laravel/framework` major plus one, not a fixed `^13`.
- Not in v0.1.0 (D8): `env-example-sync` (keys in `.env.example` vs. `config/*.php` `env()` calls) and `qiick-recommendations` (suggest `qiick/*` replacements) are mentioned in the knowledge base only as ideas ("better as a Health Check check", "Specula Health Check Recommendations"). They become `needs-decision` proposal issues, not code.

## 4. CLI UX

```
vendor/bin/excubia check [path] [options]
php artisan excubia:check [options]          # same engine, path = base_path()

Options:
  --format=table|json|markdown   Output format (default: table)
  --output=FILE                  Write report to FILE instead of stdout
  --fail-on=critical|high|medium|low|none   Minimum severity that makes the exit code 1 (default: high)
  --only=ID,ID                   Run only these checks
  --skip=ID,ID                   Skip these checks
  --no-dev                       Ignore require-dev / packages-dev
  --offline                      Use cache only; checks without cached data are `skipped`
  --no-cache                     Bypass the cache
  --config=FILE                  Config file (default: ./excubia.json if present)
  --no-banner                    Hide the ASCII banner (brand/excubia/cli/banner.txt)
  -q | -v | -vv                  Quiet / verbose / debug (HTTP calls listed)

vendor/bin/excubia cache:clear
vendor/bin/excubia --version
```

Exit codes:
- `0` no finding at or above `--fail-on`
- `1` at least one finding at or above `--fail-on`
- `2` usage or configuration error (missing `composer.lock`, broken or unparseable `composer.lock`, invalid config, unknown check id). The error message says what is wrong.
- `3` data-source failure that made a non-skippable check impossible (network down and no cache) — only when `--strict` is passed; otherwise affected checks are `skipped` with a warning and exit code ignores them. [PROPOSAL: `--strict`]

Table output: grouped by severity, coloured (no colour when not a TTY or `NO_COLOR`), summary line `3 critical · 2 high · 5 medium · 1 low` and the upgrade plan at the end. JSON output schema is versioned (`"schemaVersion": 1`) and documented in `docs/report-schema.json`.

## 5. Config file

`excubia.json` at the project root (JSON so it works without Laravel and is easy for agents to edit):

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qiick-io/excubia-core/main/excubia.schema.json",
  "failOn": "high",
  "includeDev": true,
  "checks": {
    "composer-stale": { "staleAfterMonths": 24 },
    "php-eol": { "warnDaysBeforeEol": 180 },
    "laravel-eol": { "warnDaysBeforeEol": 180 },
    "node-eol": { "enabled": true }
  },
  "ignore": [
    { "checkId": "composer-advisories", "subject": "vendor/package", "advisoryId": "GHSA-xxxx", "reason": "Not reachable", "until": "2027-01-31" }
  ],
  "cache": { "directory": null, "ttlHours": 24 }
}
```

Rules: every `ignore` entry needs a `reason`; an expired `until` makes the finding active again and prints a warning. Unknown keys are a config error (exit 2).

## 6. Supported versions

- Runtime of the tool: PHP **^8.2** so it installs as a dev dependency in Laravel 11, 12 and 13 apps (D3; the qiick app skeleton is PHP 8.4/8.5, but a CLI must reach older projects). Pest and the CI test jobs run on PHP 8.3 and newer only. There is no PHP 8.2 Pest job.
- Artisan integration: Laravel 11, 12, 13.
- Scanned projects: any Composer project; Laravel-specific checks are `skipped` when `laravel/framework` is not locked.
- Lockfiles: `composer.lock` (Composer 2), `package-lock.json` lockfileVersion 2 and 3. `yarn.lock` / `pnpm-lock.yaml` are non-goals for v0.1.0.

## 7. Security & privacy

- Only package **names and versions** (and runtime versions) leave the machine, and only to the public APIs listed in section 3. No file contents, no `.env`, no source code, no paths, no hostnames.
- No telemetry, no analytics, no phone-home.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` is optional, read from the environment only, never printed or written to the cache or report.
- All HTTP over TLS with timeouts (connect 5 s, total 15 s) and limited retries with backoff; respects `HTTPS_PROXY`.
- The tool never writes to the scanned project except `--output` and never executes project code (no app boot for `vendor/bin/excubia`).
- `SECURITY.md` with private vulnerability reporting.

## 8. Testing, CI, release

- Pest 4 unit + feature tests; Pest architecture tests for Codice Perfetto (strict types, role suffixes, readonly `*Data`, no `dd`/`dump`/`env()`).
- Fixtures: sample `composer.lock` / `composer.json` / `package-lock.json` sets in `tests/Fixtures/Projects/*` (healthy Laravel 13 app, outdated Laravel 10 app, abandoned/archived packages incl. `jenssegers/agent`, npm vulnerable lockfile, non-Laravel PHP project, broken lockfile).
- No real network in tests: recorded API responses in `tests/Fixtures/Responses/*`, an HTTP client contract with a fake.
- Static analysis: Larastan/PHPStan level max, Pint (`laravel` preset), Rector dry-run optional.
- CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): Pest, Pint, and PHPStan on PHP 8.3–8.5 × lowest/stable deps. The package floor stays PHP ^8.2. No PHP 8.2 Pest job. Pest coverage ≥ 90 % for `src/Checks`. The reusable workflow `qiick-io/.github/.github/workflows/php-package-ci.yml` remains the intended home; until that repository is available the jobs live in this repo. SHA-pinned actions.
- Dogfooding: CI runs `bin/excubia check --fail-on=critical` on the repo itself.
- Versioning: SemVer, Conventional Commits, tags `v0.1.0`, GitHub Releases with notes; Packagist `qiick/excubia-core` (D5: vendor `qiick` must be claimed on Packagist).
- Branches: `main` (releases), `develop` (integration), feature branches `<type>/<issue>-<slug>`; squash merges only.

## 9. Later milestone v0.2.0 — free zero-signup web scanner (NOT v0.1.0)

Roadmap Step 1 includes "CLI + free zero-signup web scanner". Proposed as the next milestone, on the same core:
- Page on `qiick.io/excubia` (or `qiick.io/tools/*`, D2) where users paste or drop `composer.lock` / `package-lock.json`.
- Lockfiles are **parsed in the browser**; only names and versions are sent (knowledge base rule).
- Laravel backend endpoint using the same core with queues, cache, rate limits (also the load study for the utilities suite).
- Abuse protections: per-IP rate limits, payload size caps (e.g. 2 000 packages), cached results, no storage of submitted data beyond the cache TTL, Impressum + privacy policy (Germany).
- Domain verification is only needed for Phase B (probing URLs), not for lockfile scans.

## 10. Decisions (approved by Luca on 2026-10-31)

1. **D1 CLI form:** standalone `vendor/bin/excubia` + Artisan alias `excubia:check`, or Artisan only? **Decided:** both, one engine (works in CI and non-Laravel projects; KB says "Artisan command or Composer binary").
2. **D2 Web scanner:** v0.2.0 after the CLI, and where (`qiick.io/excubia` vs `qiick.io/tools/laravel-health`)? **Decided:** v0.2.0, at `qiick.io/excubia` (product routes live inside qiick.io).
3. **D3 Tool runtime PHP:** ^8.2 or ^8.4 (fleet skeleton)? **Decided:** ^8.2, to reach Laravel 11/12 apps.
4. **D4 AI summary (KB check 7):** in v0.1.0? **Decided:** no; ship a deterministic upgrade plan now, add an opt-in AI summary later with the user's own key (no metered qiick service).
5. **D5 Packagist vendor:** claim `qiick` on Packagist with LucaGiardi20? **Decided:** yes, before the first tag.
6. **D6 SARIF output** (GitHub code scanning): v0.1.0 or later? **Decided:** later (v0.3.0 with the GitHub Action), JSON/Markdown first.
7. **D7 Node EOL check:** keep `node-eol` in v0.1.0 (brand copy promises "PHP/Node versions")? **Decided:** yes, it is small.
8. **D8 Extra checks** `env-example-sync` and `qiick-recommendations`: **Decided:** not in v0.1.0; open as proposals.
9. **D9 Config format:** `excubia.json` or `excubia.php`? **Decided:** JSON (no Laravel boot, agent-friendly, JSON Schema).
10. **D10 Default `--fail-on`:** `high` or `critical`? **Decided:** `high`.
11. **D11 Stale threshold:** 24 months without a release? **Decided:** 24 months, configurable.
12. **D12 Tagline:** keep placeholder "Health checks for Laravel apps." for v0.1.0? **Decided:** yes until the website copy is final.
13. **D13 Trademark similarity search** (TMview/EUIPO/WIPO for "Excubia") before the first public release? **Decided:** yes, before tagging v0.1.0 (open item in the brand file).

## 11. Clarifications (Luca, 2026-10-31)

These five answers are final.

1. The package floor stays PHP ^8.2. Pest and the CI test jobs run on PHP 8.3 and newer only. There is no PHP 8.2 Pest job.
2. Node version precedence is `.nvmrc`, then `.node-version`, then `package.json` `engines.node`.
3. The next Laravel major is the locked `laravel/framework` major plus one. It is not a fixed `^13`.
4. A broken or unparseable `composer.lock` is exit code 2, with a clear error message.
5. `advisoryId` is a finding field so an ignore rule can match that advisory.
